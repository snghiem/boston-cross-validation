#boston-cross-validation.R

This repository employs cross-validation on Boston's housing set. Plese note that
the point of cross-validation is not to predict on the validation set, but to
choose the best model out of model comparision.

Leave-out-one-cross-validation (LOOCV) gives approximately unbiased estimates 
of the test error. k=5 or 10-fold cross-validation perform more bias but less than
the validation set approach.
